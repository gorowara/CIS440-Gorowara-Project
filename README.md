Tarun Gorowara's Personal Project for Professor Clark's CIS 440 (1:30pm) class.

<b>PROJECT DETAILS:</b>

After learning how to develop a mobile app in my CIS440 group project. I was interested in learning more about mobile app development, but I wanted to learn more about how to develop a mobile game. I took a free tutorial called "Game Development Crash Course with Corona SDK" (Link: https://www.udemy.com/game-development-crash-course/?dtcode=p9PNALk1V07K).

Through this tutorial, I created a simple 2D mobile game. The goal of the game is to protect a planet from invading enemies. To destroy the enemies, you had to click/touch them before they reached the planet. Everytime the user successfully destroy a enemy, the user gets 5 points. The game keeps going until the planet gets hit 5 times.

For this project, I started with a framework called Corona SDK. What I really liked about Corona SDK was that it had a simulator where you can try out your game to see how it looks on a device (Iphone, Ipad, Galaxy, etc.). I used a code editor called Outlaw IDE to import files and write the program language called Lua.
